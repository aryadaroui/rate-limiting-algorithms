# rate-limiting-algorithms

Examples of simple rate limiting algorithms in TypeScript and Python. This was made for my blog post https://aryadee.dev/blog/rate-limiting-algorithms, but they've been written generically so that you can use them for yourself with minor adjustments.



**Work in progress, but I've obviously still published this repo publicly. If you're reading this message, it means I haven't cleaned things up yet. Use at your own peril.**

## Usage

These algorithms reside in functions in[ `rate_limiters.ts`]() and [`rate_limiters.py`]().

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Adjustments

To run my experiments I used `dummy_*` objects for simulation.

- You must replace my `dummy_cache` with your own data storage solution

- For the *Python* implementation
  - You must replace my `dummy_time` with realtime timestamp in **milliseconds**
    - This is excessive to Python implementation because I used static timings to verify
  - There are dataclasses provided, but not used for clarity reasons in my blog post. You are encouraged to use them

### Example

Suppose you  you have some function `request_handler()` that handles incoming network traffic. You can rate limit a specific target (e.g. the requester's IP address) by simply calling the rate limiting function and checking its `"status"`. The rate limiter function queries your remote cache, using your target as a key.

```python
def request_handler(request_ip: str):
  
  limiter_result = leaky_bucket(request_ip, limit=5.0, window_length_ms=1000.0, mode='soft')
  
  if limiter_result['status'] == 'OK':
    # üÜó process request
    # ...
  else:
    # ‚õîÔ∏è deny request
    # ...
```

### Experiments / testing

The TypeScript experiments are run in real-time with worker threads, and spawn a Python process to plot the data. The Python experiments are run statically.

#### TypeScript

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # install dependencies in requirements.txt
npm install # to install dependencies in package.json
npm run start # to run the realtime TS experiments
```

#### Python

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # install dependencies in requirements.txt
python main.py # to run the Py experiments
```

## Coverage

| Rate limiting algorithm             | Comment |
| ----------------------------------- | :--------: 
| `fixed_window(...)` |     Cross-window overshoot     | 
| `enforced_avg(...)` |     strict; no simultaneity     |  
| `sliding_window(...)` |     expensive data storage     | 
| `leaky_bucket(..., mode='soft')` |     overshoots on bucket fill     |   
| `leaky_bucket(..., mode='hard')` |     Punitive steady state     |   

 `leaky_bucket(..., mode='soft')` is the most flexible. Under continuous load, it will rate limit at steady state with a uniform distribution, and will allow transients of a maximum size of $2\times \text{limit} - 1$.

## Can I install this with NPM or PyPI? (No.)

Consider this more a collection of function snippets rather than a package. Currently, you **must** adjust the rate limiters internally for custom use, so it doesn't make sense to package it. I may grow this into a proper package in the future.

For now, this is a small amount of code; just copy-paste it :-).

## Plots

[~Plots will go here~]

- Uniform times
- Random times
- Cross-window times
